#In this project we worked with multiple tables in this database.
* The employees table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field named ReportsTo to specify who reports to whom.
* The customers table stores customers data. The line between employees.Employeeid and customers.SupportRepID shows how the two tables are related (ie, how you would JOIN them).
* The invoices table stores invoice header data (Customer ID, Billing Address, etc) and the invoice_items table stores the invoice line items data (Unit Price, Quantity).
* The artists table stores artists data.
* The albums table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.
* The media_types table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.
* The genres table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.
* The tracks table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.
* The playlists table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the playlists table and tracks table is many-to-many. 
  The playlist_track table is used to reflect this relationship.

1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to"). 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

2.Show only the Customers from Brazil. 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM Customers c
JOIN Invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE c.Country = 'Brazil';

4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM Employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table. 
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM Invoices;

6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name. 
SELECT e.FirstName, e. LastName, i.InvoiceId
FROM Employees e
JOIN Customers c 
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN Invoices i 
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers. 
SELECT i.Total, c.FirstName AS CustomerFirstName, c.LastName AS CustomerLastName, c.Country, e.FirstName AS AgentFirstName, e.LastName AS AgentLastName
FROM Invoices i
JOIN Customers c 
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
JOIN Employees e 
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId;

8.How many Invoices were there in 2009? 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS InvoiceCount
FROM Invoices
WHERE strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) = '2009';

9.What are the total sales for 2009? 
SELECT SUM(Total) AS TotalSales
FROM Invoices
WHERE strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) = '2009';

10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID. 
SELECT il.InvoiceLineId, t.Name AS TrackName
FROM InvoiceLines il
JOIN Tracks t ON il.TrackId = t.TrackId;

11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID. 
SELECT il.InvoiceLineId, t.Name AS TrackName, ar.Name AS ArtistName
FROM InvoiceLines il
JOIN Tracks t 
ON il.TrackId = t.TrackId
JOIN Albums al 
ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
JOIN Artists ar 
ON al.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId;

12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre. 
SELECT t.Name AS TrackName, al.Title AS AlbumName, mt.Name AS MediaType, g.Name AS Genre
FROM Tracks t
JOIN Albums al 
ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
JOIN MediaTypes mt 
ON t.MediaTypeId = mt.MediaTypeId
JOIN Genres g 
ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId;

13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent. 
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSales
FROM Employees e
JOIN Customers c 
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN Invoices i 
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId;

14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSales
FROM Employees e
JOIN Customers c 
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN Invoices i 
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE strftime('%Y', i.InvoiceDate) = '2009'
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;
