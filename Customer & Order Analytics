#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue , product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

Practice 1
We'll start with this query:

SELECT employee_ID
FROM employees

Which of the following lines of code will complete the query listed above so that it only retrieves employee IDs (employee_ID)) that:

1. Start with ‘14’
2. Have a single character after ‘14’
3. End with ‘9’

Wildcard Practice 1
Example	Code
A	WHERE employee_ID = '14_9'
B	WHERE employee_ID LIKE '14_9'
C	WHERE employee_ID LIKE 14_9
D	WHERE employee_ID LIKE '14'_'9'

Answer: B) WHERE employee_ID LIKE '14_9'

Practice 2
Let’s say we need to find all orderIDs in the MarSales table from the BIT_DB database where the orderID has the characters ‘16’ in the beginning, followed by one unknown character, then a ‘0’, and any number of characters for the rest.

SELECT orderID
FROM BIT_DB.MarSales

Which of the following lines of code will complete the query listed above so that it only retrieves employee IDs (employee_ID)) that:

Start with ‘16’
Have a single character after ‘16’
Followed by ‘0’
And any number of characters in the last position
Wildcard Practice 2
Example	Code
A	WHERE orderID LIKE '16%0_'
B	WHERE orderID LIKE '16%0%'
C	WHERE orderID LIKE '160_%'
D	WHERE orderID LIKE '16_0%'

Answer: D) WHERE orderID LIKE '16_0%'
